/**
 * @brief Enables DVSync to improve the smoothness of self-drawing animations.
 * DVSync, short for Decoupled VSync, is a frame timing management policy that is decoupled from the hardware's VSync.
 * DVSync drives the early rendering of upcoming animation frames by sending VSync signals with future timestamps.
 * These frames are stored in a frame buffer queue. This helps DVSync reduce potential frame drop and therefore
 * enhances the smoothness of animations.
 * DVSync requires free self-drawing frame buffers to store these pre-rendered animation frames.
 * Therefore, you must ensure that at least one free frame buffer is available. Otherwise, do not enable DVSync.
 * After DVSync is enabled, you must correctly respond to the early VSync signals and request the subsequent VSync
 * after the animation frame associated with the previous VSync is complete. In addition, the self-drawing frames must
 * carry timestamps that align with VSync.
 * After the animation ends, disable DVSync.
 * Only phones and tablets support DVSync.
 * On a platform that does not support DVSync or if another application has enabled DVSync, the attempt to enable it
 * will not take effect, and the application still receives normal VSync signals.
